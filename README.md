# The Formula 1 Project  

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§  

Welcome to my Formula 1 AI project! This repository is dedicated to exploring the fascinating world of Formula 1 racing through the lens of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**.  

## About the Project  

The goal of this project is to build an AI/ML-based application that enhances understanding, analysis, or engagement with Formula 1 racing. While the exact deliverables are not yet defined, this project aims to leverage the capabilities of AI and data analysis to uncover unique insights or create interactive tools related to F1.  

## Key Features (Planned)  
- Data extraction and analysis using [FastF1](https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1).  
- AI/ML models for:  
  - Predictive analytics (e.g., lap times, race outcomes).  
  - Driver or car performance analysis.  
  - Track optimization strategies or simulations.  
- Visualizations and interactive tools to make insights accessible.  

## Tools and Libraries  
- **FastF1**: For accessing and analyzing F1 data.  
- **Python**: Primary programming language.  
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Likely to include frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn.  
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for creating insightful visualizations.  

## How to Use  
This project is in the early stages of development. Please check back for updates on how to set up and use the application as it evolves.  

## Progress  
- [-] Research and understand FastF1 library.  
- [-] Gather and preprocess F1 data.  
- [ ] Design and train AI/ML models.  
- [ ] Build an interactive interface or dashboard (if applicable).  

## Future Goals  
- Explore potential use cases for AI in Formula 1 racing, from race strategy to fan engagement.  
- Collaborate with fellow F1 and AI enthusiasts to expand the scope of this project.
